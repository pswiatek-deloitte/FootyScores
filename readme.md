# Take-Home Assignment

You are working on a pipeline responsible for validating the API implementation of the FootyScores application. FootyScores provides football (soccer) match data through a public API.

The goal of this task is to design a solution that supports automated API testing using real-world data from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. To enable this, the testing pipeline requires a reference definition of how the API endpoints should look for each football match played during the Olympic Games.

## Your task is to:

* Design and implement a CLI tool that generates the expected API endpoint for every football match.

* The generated endpoints will serve as reference values for automated tests validating the FootyScores API.

* Use the official Olympic Games competition schedule as the source of truth for match data:

## Acceptance Criteria

### The solution will be considered complete when the following criteria are met:

#### CLI Functionality

* The tool can be executed from the command line.
* Running the tool produces a list of API endpoints, one per football match played during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

#### Data Source

* Match data is derived from the official Olympic Games competition schedule.
* The tool correctly identifies and processes only football (soccer) matches.

#### Endpoint Generation

* Each generated endpoint follows a consistent and well-defined structure, exactly the same as in example.json
* The endpoint uniquely represents a single football match.
* All matches in the schedule are covered with no duplicates or omissions.

#### Deterministic Output

* Given the same input data, the tool always produces the same output.
* The output order is predictable and documented (e.g. sorted by date and kickoff time).

## Submission Requirements

Please create a repository containing your solution and include clear instructions on how to install, run, and deploy the code. Please submit your work by sharing a GitHub repository link.

## Development setup

This project uses TypeScript with Node.js 22 or newer and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

The `check` command runs formatting verification, ESLint, TypeScript
type-checking, the test suite, and a production build.

Useful local commands:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run test:watch
npm run build
npm start
```

Source code belongs in `src/`, tests belong in `test/`, and generated files are
written to `dist/`. Automated tests must use offline fixtures rather than the
live Olympic schedule. The schedule URL remains the authoritative source for
refreshing or validating fixture data.
